traygent
========

A ssh-agent(1) that lives in your system tray and allows you to run arbitrary commands when:
- A key is added.
- A key is removed.
- A signing request comes in.

This can be used to tie in an external application for verification of key usage, or to send desktop notifications when a key is added/removed.
